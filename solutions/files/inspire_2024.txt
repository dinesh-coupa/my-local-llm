General Information
What will I learn?
Coupa Inspire is a unique experience where leaders at every level gather to learn, share, and grow together. You’ll meet people at the peak of their careers who are eager to share how they are transforming their career, their businesses, and the world with the power of spend. You will learn how to leverage Business Spend Management as a strategic asset to fuel your company’s performance, profitability, and progress. 

 

Who will I meet?
An elite cast of the most forward-thinking individuals in the industry. You’ll meet fellow Heads of Finance, Chief Procurement Officers, Chief Supply Chain Officers, Treasurers, CIOs who are united by their interest in innovative decision making around spend management, as well as their teams, and top talent.

What will I gain from this experience? What else can I expect?
No matter your role in your organization, you’ll walk away with insights, connections, and ideas you won’t get anywhere else. This is a unique opportunity to join thousands of the brightest leaders in your field as you gather to exchange ideas and have authentic conversations. You’ll leave feeling engaged, energized, and empowered.

Inspire is about presence: you’ll get as much out of it as you put into it. You’ll learn from your peers in breakout sessions where people aren’t afraid to be honest about their journeys. You’ll be challenged to push boundaries and achieve more. You’ll experience everything from high-energy keynotes and community gatherings, to thoughtful hands-on learning experiences. And when it’s over, you’ll take ideas back to your business that will help you spend smarter and achieve true operational excellence.

Sponsorship
How do I become a Sponsor at Coupa Inspire 2024?
Coupa Partner attendance is exclusively through sponsorship. Please contact Christa Fritz, Coupa Alliance programming at christa.fritz@coupa.com if you are interested in becoming a sponsor.

Suitcasing Policy
Suitcasing is the act of soliciting business in the aisles during the exhibition or in other public spaces by non-exhibiting companies, including another company’s booth or a hotel lobby. It is Coupa Inspire’s objective to do everything legally possible to protect our Exhibitors from suitcasing. We want our Exhibitors to know that Coupa is tough on suitcasers, and that we are vigilant in our efforts to stop them in order to prevent Exhibitor unhappiness and show erosion.

Please note that while all meeting attendees are invited to the Community Village and Expo, any attendee who is observed to be soliciting business in the aisles or other public spaces, in another company’s booth, or in violation of any portion of the Exhibit Policies, will be asked to leave immediately. Additional penalties may be applied. Please report any violations you may observe to the Event Staff. Coupa recognizes that suitcasing may also take the form of commercial activity conducted from a hotel guest room or hospitality suite; a restaurant, club, or any other public place of assembly. For the purposes of this policy, suitcasing violations may occur at venues other than the exhibition floor and at other events. Requests for hospitality suites must be approved by Coupa Inspire and are only available to confirmed exhibitors.

Where should I stay and how do I book a hotel room?
We are pleased to offer a room block at the Aria at the guaranteed lowest conference rate of $229 per night (plus tax and resort fee). Once you register for Coupa Inspire, you will receive the link to book your sleeping room.

The special room rate will be available through Tuesday, March 29, 2024, or until the room block is full. A credit card is required at the time of booking and a deposit equal to one night’s room and tax will be charged.
